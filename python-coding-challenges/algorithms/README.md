# Algorithms

This subfolder contains classic algorithms and data structure implementations in Python.  
You'll find code for sorting, searching, trees, stacks, recursion, and other foundational techniques.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (binary search, linear search)
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, trees)
- Recursion, prefix sums, monotonic stacks, sliding windows
- Practice utilities and helper functions

## 🛠️ Usage

- Each `.py` file demonstrates a specific concept or algorithm.
- Code is written for learning, practice, and interview prep.

## 💡 Tip

Explore the code, run the scripts, and adapt the algorithms for your own projects or problem-solving practice!
