Problem: 0167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/

Description:
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed).

Approach:
Two pointers â€” start at both ends and move towards each other to find the pair.

Time Complexity:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
