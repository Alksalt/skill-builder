Problem: 0274. H-Index
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/

Description:
    Given a list of citations, compute the researcher's h-index.

Approach:
    Sort citations and find the maximum h such that at least h papers have â‰¥ h citations.

Time Complexity: O(N log N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
