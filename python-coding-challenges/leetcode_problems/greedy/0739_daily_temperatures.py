Problem: 0739. Daily Temperatures
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

Description:
Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list such that for each day,
tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for that, put 0 instead.

Approach:
Monotonic Stack â€“ store indices of unresolved days in decreasing order of temperature.
For each temperature, pop all indices from the stack with smaller temperatures and compute the wait.

Time Complexity:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        stack = []  # Stores indices
        n = len(temperatures)
        result = [0] * n

        for i in range(n):
            while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
                idx = stack.pop()
                result[idx] = i - idx
            stack.append(i)

        return result
